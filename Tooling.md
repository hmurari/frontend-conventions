# Tooling

Here is all the tooling we use for Regenwald. Make sure to have all this installed and set up.

- [Eslint](eslint.org) is a JavaScript linter for es6 and up. We have our own [eslint config](https://github.com/rainforestapp/eslint-config-rainforest) which is also an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-rainforest). There are plugins for most editors, pick one that suits you.
- [FlowType](http://flowtype.org/) is Facebooks static type checker for JavaScript. We use it to annotate our functions and components with types. This is still a little in flux, because editor support isn't great.
- [Chrome React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) are essential for inspecting your react applications at runtime.
- [Firefox React Dev Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/) if you use firefox :)
- [Redux Dev Tools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) will let you see the data flow of your redux application, as well as time-travel.
