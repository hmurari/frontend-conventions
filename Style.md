General style guidelines

- Favour ternaries over if statements only if they are short easy to read one liners.
- Never nest ternaries.
- Double-quotes for 'static' react propTypes like `<something some="hello"/>`.
- Backtick quotes for string concatenation, also in jsx: ```<something some=`${a}_${b}`/>```
